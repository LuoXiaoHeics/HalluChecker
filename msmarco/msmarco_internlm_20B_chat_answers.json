What record keeping does someone with a 1040ez generally need to do? I used to do all my taxes by hand. I figured about 8 hours total for federal and state and my tax situation was not simple. I did a full 1040 with stock sales, itemized deductions and rental properties. They list \u201c1 hour for form submission\u201d. How does that take 1 hour? Most people hit \u2018submit\u2019 on their tax software and other people shove them in an envelope and put them in the mail. Where do they get 1 hour from?\nPassage 1: All Things Tax. Like the title says, from the filing process and tax questions to tax policy and reform, you can search and share All Things Tax here. This is the place to find answers to all your general questions that don't fall under the other categories. And just a reminder: questions about software or online filing should be posted in DIY Products.\nPassage 2: Right now the IRS is busy because so many people are trying to get their refunds so they can spend them. But if you wait until Mar 1 to file you can get it a lot quicker since they wont be backlogged.\nPassage 3: To be fair, we have 318,000,000 citizens, so roughly 1/3 of all available 9-digit numbers are currently being used by people who are alive right now. I'm not sure how long you have to be dead before they recycle your number, if they do at all, but I'd think at this point they would have had to start recycling.\nPassage 4: The most common mistakes, which can cause delays in receiving a refund, are listed below: 1  Social security number missing or incorrect. 2  Incorrect tax result, given reported income and filing status, was entered.\nPassage 5: How long does it usually take H&R Block to do taxes? I dropped off a LOT of things to a guy at H&R Block 2 weeks ago and haven't heard back from him, he hasn't returned my calls.\nPassage 6: The IRS has notified us that your tax refund is ready to be transferred to H&R Block Bank. As a result, H&R Block Bank has initiated the process to deposit your Simple Pay proceeds* into your bank account. This process is usually completed within 2-3 business days but could take additional time, depending on your bank's direct deposit process.\nPassage 7: 1 Enrollment in, or completion of the H&R Block Income Tax Course is neither an offer nor a guarantee of employment. Additional qualifications may be required. 2  The course consists of 81 hours of instruction in Oregon and 88 hours of instruction in California.\nPassage 8: When the deposit does not go thru the IRS will send you a paper check in 6-8 weeks.

The other side of security is whether Skype imposes risk on its users' computers and networks. In October 2005 a pair of security flaws were discovered and patched.\nPassage 1: SurveilStar is the best Skype monitoring software that secretly records all Skype incoming and outgoing text chats. SurveilStar Skype monitoring software is not a simple IM recording tool. It is an intelligent Skype recorder that logs the exact chat messages, including Skype user names & emails, timestamps of their chats, and full length instant message conversations.\nPassage 2: There is less risk emailing files but people can hack your account. There may be some kind of encryption out there but I doubt if a service like skype would allow it. You might send an encrypted file but what one person can do another person can undo. The US mail is the most private and secure way to send data.\nPassage 3: Answer Wiki. You simply can't unless you can trust every piece of hardware that handles the raw video and audio stream, meaning your entire computer and the recipients entire computer.\nPassage 4: Sign in to Skype Manager and go to the Reports section. In the Usage tab, click I want to access the reports. Enter the name of the member you want to view detailed activity reports for. A report on the member\u2019s Skype Credit usage for the specified month is displayed.\nPassage 5: Skype's encryption is inherent in the Skype Protocol and is transparent to callers. Skype is not considered to be a secure VoIP system as the calls made over the network are routinely monitored by Microsoft and by government agencies.\nPassage 6: Skype is a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) system developed by Skype Technologies S.A. It is a peer-to-peer network in which voice calls pass over the Internet rather than through a special-purpose network.\nPassage 7: Sign in to Skype Manager and go to the Reports section. In the Usage tab, click I want to access the reports. (You can remove access to this information at any time by changing the settings on this page.) Enter the name of the member you want to view detailed activity reports for. A report on the member\u2019s Skype Credit usage for the specified month is displayed.\nPassage 8: And even then you must be trustful of the environment in which the video session is done: a hidden microphone or webcam might be two of the easiest ways of effectively bypassing all your hard-labored security measures.\nPassage 9: SurveilStar's IM File Transfer Policy is used to monitor and control all outgoing files through Instant Messenger applications, such as Skype, MSN, and ICQ. It can block suspicious file transfer via any of these IM tools, by file name, file size, or file extension.\n\nAnswer: \n",

However, if you have multiple PCs and devices you want to protect, BullGuard is an outstanding value at only $59.95 for one year of coverage.\nPassage 5: If you have CDs, floppy disks, external hard drives, USB drives or other removable media inserted in or connected to the PC, remove or disconnect them immediately.

President Clinton promised this month not to pardon himself. It's surprising to see Clinton voluntarily relinquish a legal weapon, but even more surprising that he had his hands on it in the first place.\nPassage 1: Of course the President can pardon himself. He is, after all, the executive, part of whose constitutional duty under Article 2 is to bring prosecutions and punish the guilty. You can't jail the head jailer, and you can't prosecute the head prosecutor's boss, unless he allows it.\nPassage 2: The simplest interpretation is that the president can pardon any federal criminal offense, including his own, but cannot pardon an impeachment. In other words, Clinton is free to immunize himself from criminal prosecution, but has no power over Congress.\nPassage 3: The power to pardon is one of the least limited powers granted to the President in the Constitution. The only limits mentioned in the Constitution are that pardons are limited to offenses against the United States (i.e., not civil or state cases), and that they cannot affect an impeachment process.\nPassage 4: The President has broad discretionary power to use his Constitutional authority to pardon someone for Federal crimes \u2014 there is no specific limitation in the Constitution to whether these crimes are past, present, or future; nor any limitation on who may receive the pardon:\nPassage 5: The Constitution says that the president shall have the power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.. This sentence, like many in the Constitution, can reasonably be interpreted in several ways.\nPassage 6: The pardon power has been and will remain a powerful constitutional tool of the President. Its use has the potential to achieve much good for the polity or to increase political conflict. Only the wisdom of the President can ensure its appropriate use.\nPassage 7: A pardon can be issued from the time an offense is committed, and can even be issued after the full sentence has been served. It cannot, however, be granted before an offense has been committed, which would give the President the power to waive the laws.\nPassage 8: The fact that a particular POTUS would have pardoned himself would not be given much weight in prosecution by the World Court, or by the court of another country. There have been suggestions in the past that a specific POTUS would exercise the right to pardon himself.\nPassage 9: The Constitution gives the president the right to pardon anyone, except if the president is impeached. Technically, President Richard Nixon could have pardoned himself. A president can pardon himself according to the interpretation by the Supreme Court.\n\nAnswer: \n",

        "input": "Please answer the following question based on the provided passages.\n\nQuestion: what is the max charitable donation?\n\nPassages:\nPassage 0: As with all itemized deductions, timing is everything. You can take the deduction for your contribution in the year that you make it. For example, if you mailed a check to your favorite charity on December 31, you can write it off on that year's tax return.\nPassage 1: Claiming. When you figure out your taxes, first write off any deductions to 50 percent limit groups. If those add up to less than half of your AGI, start claiming deductions to 30 percent groups as well.\nPassage 2: In order for your donation to be deductible, it must go to a nonprofit group that is approved by the IRS. Most often, these are charitable, religious or educational organizations, though they can also be everything from your local volunteer fire company to a group for the prevention of cruelty to animals.\nPassage 3: You may claim a tax credit for voluntary cash contributions you make during any taxable year to. a Qualifying Charitable Organization. A Qualifying Charitable Organization is a charity that is a. 501(c)(3) or a community action agency that receives community services block grant program. monies that spends at least 50% of its budget on services to Arizona residents who either.\nPassage 4: With some organizations, the limit is even less: If you donate to veterans' organizations, fraternal societies, nonprofit cemeteries, and certain private foundations, the limit is 30 percent. Suppose, for example, that your AGI is $90,000 and you donate money to charities in both groups. Your total donations must be under $45,000 and donations to the second group must be less than $30,000.\nPassage 5: You may only claim a tax credit for your charitable contribution on your Arizona state return if the organization you donated to is considered a Qualifying Charitable Organization. A complete listing of Qualifying Charitable Organizations is published on the Department of Revenue\u2019s website.\nPassage 6: Even if you give all your income to charity, you can't claim a 100 percent tax deduction. The IRS has multiple rules limiting how much of your charitable donations you can deduct. If you're donating 20 percent of your adjusted gross income or less, don't worry: The rules don't kick in unless you're donating at least 30 percent.\nPassage 7: Also, keep in mind that you can't write off a contribution to the extent that you get something in return. For example, if you buy a $50 ticket to a fundraising dinner at a church, but the cost of the dinner is $20, you can deduct $30.\nPassage 8: The credit is available only to individuals. You report the name of the Qualifying Charitable. Organization you donated to as well as the dollar amount of your donation to the Department. of Revenue on Form 321.\nPassage 9: Donations are limited. There's also a limit on how much you can deduct. The basic rule is that your contributions to public charities, colleges and religious groups can't exceed 50 percent of your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). The caps are a bit lower for gifts to other types of nonprofits.\n\nAnswer: \n",

As you can see in the list above, quite a few of the diseases that have a direct relation to the body\u2019s pH balance being too acidic are ones that are known to be caused by a diet that is too high in sugar.\nPassage 1: The Promise. It's a pitch Hollywood celebs love: that the alkaline diet -- also known as the alkaline ash diet or alkaline acid diet -- can help you lose weight and avoid problems like arthritis and cancer. The theory is that some foods, like meat, wheat, refined sugar, and processed foods, cause your body to produce acid, which is bad for you. Eating specific foods that make your body more alkaline, on the other hand, can protect against those conditions as well as shed pounds.\nPassage 2: Sugar substitute, Cancer Diet\u201d. 1  Making Chocolate is so simple. [\u2026] 2  I am not too sure how nutritious the pie is, but it did have 8 Braeburn apples in it, sucanat and honey as the sweetners, almond meal as the crust, and oats as part of the topping. 3  Maple Syrup is Alkaline.\nPassage 3: As the lemon water becomes more dilute it will approach the pH of \u2026the water. Tap water is commonly slightly alkaline (pH 7.4 or so) and so at very high dilutions the lemon water will exceed 7, but then there really isn't much lemon in it by that stage. pH < 7 is acidic, pH > 7 is alkaline.\nPassage 4: Here is a section from one of my favorite Alkaline Chart websites. It places honey on the cusp, but puts raw honey in the alkaline department. There are several versions of the Acidic and Alkaline Food chart to be found in different books and on the Internet.\nPassage 5: However, while they may not result in a hospital visit, subtle pH fluctuations outside of the normal range can still cause problems. Because the majority of people consume way too much sugar many walk around with a body pH that is far too acidic.\nPassage 6: Pure water is neither acid nor alkaline: it is (essentially) neutral pH= 7.0 (at 25 oC). Municipal tap water is normally very slightly lakaline (pH=8), sometimes 'natural so\u2026urce' water are slightly acidic (pH=5 to 6) depending on well, river, lake or ground conditions.\nPassage 7: I believe that an excess of sugar and carbohydrates in the average American diet is the main culprit of today\u2019s massive and still growing health issues. In one of the richest and most modern countries on the face of the earth, we are plagued with some of the worst health issues on the planet.\nPassage 8: The honey I am talking about now is raw honey and it is alkaline. or at least on the cusp between alkaline and acidic. The reason I am experimenting with honey is to find an acceptable sweetner for some of the dishes I enjoy. One of the reasons honey landed in my lap is because of my research with the Budwig Diet.\nPassage 9: Is sugar water a base or acid? Sugar water would typically be neutral, so neither acidic or basic. Lemon juice is acidic and pure water is neutral but then why is 'lemon water' alkaline? Lemon water is still acidic, you can easily test this yourself with a basic pH meter (they don't cost much).\n\nAnswer: \n",

The design of Disneyland's Space Mountain was replicated at Tokyo Disneyland in 1983 and Hong Kong Disneyland in 2005; the Tokyo version was significantly changed in 2006.\nPassage 1: The Open Space & Mountain Parks Department manages permanently protected land and area that is now approximately 45,000 acres, contains approximately 150 miles of developed and maintained trails, and receives approximately 5.3 million human visits per year based on the 2004-2005 Visitation Study data.\nPassage 2: Space Mountain at RCDB. Space Mountain is a space-themed indoor steel roller coaster in Tomorrowland at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Opened on May 27, 1977, it was the second roller coaster built at Disneyland, and was the second of the five versions of Space Mountain built by The Walt Disney Company. Its exterior fa\u00e7ade is one of Disneyland's four mountain structures that serve as park landmarks.\nPassage 3: Note: Space Mountain has been transformed in to Hyperspace Mountain as part of the Star Wars Season of the Force event. When you ride you'll see Tie Fighters and X-Wings battle it out while you hear some fantastic music from the Star Wars films. Hyperspace Mountain is expected to last until late-2016.\nPassage 4: The adventure begins as Admiral Ackbar briefs you on your mission: the Rebel Alliance needs your help flying a reconnaissance vessel to survey an Imperial Star Destroyer spotted near Jakku\u2014a desert planet featured in the new movie, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. An elite X-wing squadron escorts you into hyperspace. You arrive at your destination to find the Star Destroyer waiting for you, surrounded by a swarm of TIE fighters. It's a trap! As the Rebels valiantly battle the Imperial vessels, you're caught up in the barrage of red and green blaster fire. The speed and the turns grow more intense as the Rebel squadron begins their final, courageous assault on the menacing Star Destroyer.\nPassage 5: Regulations to Help. Us Serve You. Open spaces are managed for diverse. habitats and the wildlife they support. Regulations protect you and the natural. resources of the open spaces. Tips. u Please leave your dog at home. This is. a dog-free open space.\nPassage 6: Space Mountain makes the leap to hyperspace as Star Wars invades the classic high-speed, outer space adventure. Rocket into a Star Wars Battle. Dodge blaster fire as you dash through a raging dogfight between Rebel X-wing starfighters and Imperial TIE fighters.\nPassage 7: Opening and early years[edit] The second Space Mountain opened in 1977, invigorating a decade-old Tomorrowland as Disneyland's second roller coaster. The $20 million complex opened May 27 including the roller coaster, 1,100-seat Space Stage, 670-seat Space Place restaurant, and the Starcade video arcade.\nPassage 8: Roller-coaster aficionados will tell you (correctly) that Space Mountain is a designer version of the Wild Mouse, a midway ride that's been around for at least 50 years. There are no long drops or swooping hills as there are on a traditional roller coaster - only quick, unexpected turns and small drops.\nPassage 9: Open Space and Mountain Parks Department Profile. The mission of the Open Space and Mountain Parks Department (OSMP) is to preserve and protect the natural environment and land resources that characterize Boulder. We foster appreciation and uses that sustain the natural values of the land for current and future generations.\n\nAnswer: \n",

Among youth, heavy cannabis use is associated with cognitive problems and increased risk of mental illness.\nPassage 1: As a result of these studies, people have incorrectly inferred that marijuana use causes mental illness. However, this assumption stems from a basic misunderstanding of research results; namely, the fact that correlation does not imply causation. You may have heard this before.\nPassage 2: This plant material can also be concentrated in a resin called hashish or a sticky black liquid called hash oil. THC is believed to be the main chemical ingredient that produces the psychoactive effect. Marijuana is often smoked in hand-rolled cigarettes (joints), pipes, or water pipes (bongs).\nPassage 3: A glance through research results on CBD from studies around the world shows evidence to support what we know already: CBD marijuana can help mental health conditions. These users are often careful in dosage, some even using just a few drops or \u201chomeopathic\u201d doses to get the desired effects.\nPassage 4: Cannabis for Treating Mental Health Conditions? A Clear Yes, Maybe. Marijuana is now legal in two states, and legal for medical use in 23 states and the District of Columbia. Polls show the majority of Americans support cannabis legalization, and more and more of the country is joining the legalization trend.\nPassage 5: There is growing evidence that people with serious mental illness, including depression and psychosis, are more likely to use cannabis or have used it for long periods of time in the past. Regular use of the drug has appeared to double the risk of developing a psychotic episode or long-term schizophrenia.\nPassage 6: This leaflet looks at the research on the effects of cannabis use and mental health and is for anyone who is concerned about the issue. We hope that this will help people to make informed choices about using - or not using - cannabis. Cannabis is the most widely used substance in the UK.\nPassage 7: Around the country, medical marijuana cards are routinely given to people suffering anxiety, depression, insomnia, ADHD, trauma, and mental health issues.\nPassage 8: However, due to the possible exacerbation of psychotic mental illness that medical marijuana has the potential to cause, it should be used under the supervision of a physician who is aware of the patient\u2019s current physical status and full medical (including mental health, family, and social) history.\nPassage 9: Marijuana, or Cannabis, refers to the dried leaves, flowers, stems, and seeds from the hemp plant Cannabis sativa, which contains the psychoactive (mind-altering) chemical delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), as well as other related compounds.\n\nAnswer: \n",

Clean snakes have very little -- if any -- odor. Lacking hair, feathers or dander, and shedding their skin in a punctuated, periodic manner, snakes do not produce smelly detritus like mammals and birds do.\nPassage 1: Snakes dont really smell, if they are kept clean. Your right about picking up there poop, if you dont they will start to smell. To smell my snakes i have to put the snake right up to my nose, i think they smell a bit like vinigar, but its not a strong smell. No... I have a snake... and you are absolutely right... as long as you clean up after them they do not smell bad. If you sniff them closely (don't ask me why I did this, lol)...\nPassage 2: However, some snakes find hibernacula by tracking conspecifics with their forked tongues and vomeronasal sense. Clean snakes have very little -- if any -- odor. Lacking hair, feathers or dander, and shedding their skin in a punctuated, periodic manner, snakes do not produce smelly detritus like mammals and birds do.\nPassage 3: How Do Snakes Smell: The Jacobson Organ. Hi, Blaine here! Tracey let me have the reigns today thanks to stinky socks, an old friend, and a reptilian pet! You see, I have this friend Pete who has earned the nickname \u201cStinky Pete\u201d thanks to his smelly socks.\nPassage 4: I also have 2 dogs & a ferret... I can definitely smell them, but I never really smell the snake. my actual snakes do not smell. i have 4 ball pythons and the only time its smells is when you clean the poop or leave it in too long. but i have never held a snake that smelled.\nPassage 5: Many people describe the dens and snakes as smelling like cucumbers; others describe the scent as skunklike, while some argue that the dens smell like decay. Klauber himself suggests that rattlesnake musk is not particularly pungent and he does not believe humans can smell dens from afar.\nPassage 6: We have a neighborhood black snake. I found it trying to get into my kitchen through the dog door two weeks ago. Wednesday my neighbor found it tangled in the bird netting in his garden and freed it. This morning one of my dogs was after something around the tool shed. She would not leave it alone. I think it was the snake. She acted like she could smell it.\nPassage 7: Snakes have an eye on each side of the head, giving them a wide field of view, but they cannot focus them well and have sharp vision for only a short distance. Snakes lack outer ears and eardrums, but they do have inner ears and can hear a limited range of sounds carried in the air. Certain bones in a snake's head respond to sound waves and transmit them to the inner ear. A snake's tongue has few taste buds. It is used with an organ of smell called the Jacobson's organ, which, along with the nostrils, provides snakes with a keen sense of smell. The Jacobson's organ consists of two hollow sacs in the roof of a snake's mouth, each of which has many nerve endings that are extremely sensitive to odors.\nPassage 8: Done by a professional, they put a rattle snake in a wire cage hidden in some cover. Then you work your bird dog in on the snake and as soon as they get a whiff of snake and show interest, nail the shit out of them on an e-collar. You want them to associate the smell of a rattlesnake with pain.\nPassage 9: In actuality, most credible sources discount such an association -- under normal circumstances, most humans find that snakes have no odor. Save for a few special circumstances, human noses do not detect smells in snake dens, either.\n\nAnswer: \n",

HENRY: It wasn't Department of Justice privilege, it was executive privilege. It was invoked by the president, not the Attorney General. EARNEST: I can tell you that it's the Department of Justice that can discuss those e-mails with you. What is clear is that this lawsuit that has been filed by Judicial Watch actually doesn't have anything to do with the actual Fast & Furious operation.\nPassage 1: President Obama said in his last two State of the Union addresses that he would use orders to meet policy goals if Congress didn\u2019t act on certain requests.\nPassage 2: The presidents who used orders and proclamations the most, per year, were Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover and Woodrow Wilson. Moreover, President Obama has issued the fewest executive orders per year, at 33.27 annually, since President Grover Cleveland\u2019s first term in the White House.\nPassage 3: Please enable Javascript to watch this video. ED HENRY: The conservative group Judicial Watch has just put out a statement yesterday I believe saying that the president months ago invoked executive privilege on Fast & Furious included 20 e-mails between the Attorney General, his wife, and his mother.\nPassage 4: The invocation of executive privilege allows the president to defy requests and subpoenas by members of the legislative and judicial branches for information the White House deems sensitive. Obama's decision will allow him to refuse to provide certain documents pertaining to the Fast and Furious program.\nPassage 5: Holder, who met with Issa Tuesday in an attempt to reach an agreement on how many and which documents related to Fast and Furious he would turn over, had formally written Obama requesting that he exercise executive privilege.\nPassage 6: AP. President Barack Obama has asserted executive privilege in response to requests made by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, who has embarked on a controversial investigation into the Department of Justice's Operation Fast and Furious gun-running program.\nPassage 7: No president ever used the phrase \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d until the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration. The phrase was not a part of the common language. Nonetheless, all presidents going back to George Washington have exercised some form of what we today call executive privilege.\nPassage 8: Executive privilege is the constitutional principle that permits the president and high-level executive branch officers to withhold information from Congress, the courts, and ultimately the public. This presidential power is controversial because it is nowhere mentioned in the U.S. Constitution.\nPassage 9: President Truman issued a robust 896 executive orders over almost eight years in office. President Obama has issued 184 orders so far in his presidency. His predecessor, President George W. Bush, issued 291 orders over eight years, while President Bill Clinton had 364 executive orders during his two terms in office.\n\nAnswer: \n",

I hadn\u2019t known a lot about Soros (except that his name keeps coming up on right wing hit lists - which, taken alone, makes him admirable).\nPassage 1: George Soros (born August 12, 1930 in Hungary) is a leftist American businessman and one of the richest people in the world, current networth estimated to be at about $8.4 billion. The birth-name of George Soros is Gy\u00f6rgy Schwartz, he changed his family name in 1936 from Schwartz to Soros to avoid antisemitism. George Soros later said that he grew up in a Jewish, anti-semitic home, and that his parents were uncomfortable with their religious roots.. Soros is an atheist.\nPassage 2: On the surface, it would appear that Soros would be opposed to many positions of the Catholic Church. A major financial backer of the ACLU, Soros supports such causes as drug legalization, the rights of \u201csex workers\u201d and felons, euthanasia, radical feminism, abortion rights, and homosexual rights.\nPassage 3: George Soros has personally expressed a strong disliking of President Bush. In 2004 he stated defeating Bush was the central focus of my life, and a matter of life and death.. He also said America, under Bush, is a danger to the world and claimed [Bush] is undermining American values.\nPassage 4: But the story has taken a strange turn. It has now been revealed that George Soros, the billionaire hedge fund operator and well-known atheist, has been pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into \u201cprogressive\u201d Catholic groups that are significant players in the national debates over health care and immigration.\nPassage 5: An AIM investigation also finds, however, that Soros money has gone into the Catholic Legal Immigration Network (CLINIC), an organization established by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops back in 1988.\nPassage 6: By shady character / August 17th, 2007 / Atheist of the Week / 9458 commentshttp://www.blacksunjournal.com/atheism/atheist-of-the-week/945_george-soros_2007.htmlGeorge+Soros2007-08-17+19%3A37%3A37shady+character. George Soros, AKA: The Man Who Broke the Bank of England, was born August 12, 1930, in Budapest, Hungary. Son of Teodoro Schwartz, a Hungarian Jew, Soros survived the Nazi occupation of his country, the subsequent Battle of Budapest, and fled Soviet Communism by emigration to London in 1947.\nPassage 7: 2004 Presidential Elections in the United States. During the 2004 election, George Soros donated $23,581,000 to various liberal 527 Groups dedicated to defeating President George W. Bush. Soros contributed $3 million to the leftist propagandist Center for American Progress and $5 million to radical leftist MoveOn.org.\nPassage 8: George Soros. The real hatred of George W. Bush that seeps from the skin of George Soros is caused by his hatred of God. George W. Bush is a man of faith, a man who puts God before everything else, and a man who prays on his knees for God\u2019s wisdom each day.\nPassage 9: It has received at least $530,000 from the Open Society Institute. The two issues merge in the fact that the Catholic Bishops are demanding that national health care legislation cover illegal aliens.\n\nAnswer: \n",

To change the Timing belt you have to take the accesory belts and brackets in the front of the engine to reach the timing belt. The lowermost one is the crankshaft pulley, which has a bolt recall (03 sorento).

The price of the actual belt is under $100 but was quoted $900 to replace it.\nPassage 8: Hello Paul, The Kia Sorento 2.5 CRDI with engine code D4CB in an interference engine, absolutley positive as I've just removed the head off my one that I bought with a broken timing chain 4 out of 16 rockers broken and definately 8 out of 16 valves bent, going to replace all rockers, valves and tappets as a precaution.\nPassage 9: Knoking as in metalic engine , or knocking as in gas preignition.

With this, you can enter the country with less than six months validity on you passport.\nPassage 9: It is not a requirement of the U.S. government. The six month validity passport rule is a requirement of other countries accepting foreign travelers. The six month passport validity rule is enforced because nations do not want to risk having travelers and tourists overstaying their passport validity.ome countries are more relaxed about the 6 month passport validity rule.

The scientific community isn't certain.\nPassage 1: Best Answer: Greg Paul portrayed T. rex as living a short violent life and usually suffering an early violent death. That makes sense given evidence not only for intraspecific combat but lethally armed prey, such as Triceratops/Torosaurus which we know T. rex and its relatives fought with. Although a T. rex might make it to age 30, it was likely to die not long after sexual maturity in its teens.\nPassage 2: Best Answer: Greg Paul portrayed T. rex as living a short violent life and usually suffering an early violent death.

The facility underwent a name change in 1941 and became known as Lubbock General Hospital, which, according to The First 62 Years: A History of Methodist Hospital, was a title more representative of the wide range of services provided. Four years later, the name changed to Lubbock Memorial Hospital.\nPassage 1: Lubbock General Hospital opened on February 1, 1978. Since then it has grown from a simple four story building to what is now called University Medical Center. It stands six stories high with a cancer center and more than 400 beds, including a Conference Center that bears the name of Don McInturff, one of the early Board of Managers.\nPassage 2: Once the school of medicine was approved, an affiliation agreement between it and the Lubbock County Hospital District was signed, according to Lubbock: From Town to City. The agreement created a partnership between the medical school and Lubbock General Hospital, which later became University Medical Center.\nPassage 3: Salem has been affiliated with the hospital since his arrival in 1962, and he has seen Lubbock become a high-quality regional health hub in the ensuing years. Of course, that was almost destined to happen, thanks to the efforts of some of the city's first physicians, said local historian Paul Carlson.\nPassage 4: It has also helped change the perception of the hospital from what was once considered a place for indigent care to what is now considered a premier facility, with that all important partnership with the Texas Tech Medical School.\nPassage 5: McInturff says he remembers the early days, when Lubbock General got off to a really rocky start.

We made some changes with management and it started evolving.\nPassage 6: ...others on staff felt believed was a better reflection of the facility's mission.

Hutchinson, Dr. O.F. Peebler and Dr. A.R. Ponton. The 35-bed facility included a laboratory and operating room.\nPassage 9: Four years later, the name changed to Lubbock Memorial Hospital.

In 2002, an eruption by Nyiragongo destroyed much of the nearby town of Goma, leaving 200,000 people homeless. The eruption spread lava as far as the northern end of the runway at Goma International Airport - around 12 miles (20km) away.\nPassage 1: The residential area in eastern Goma, where 15 percent of the population lives, does not have electricity. Mt. Nyiragongo erupted at approximately 9:30 AM local time (2:30 AM EST) on January 17. The volcano produced three paths of lava, one of which headed toward the city of Goma, 18 kilometers to the south. A fourth fissure opened at 4:00 PM on January 17. The area had been experiencing tremors intermittently since March 2001.\nPassage 2: Italian geologist Francesco Pandolfo travelled to Africa to study the volcanic activity on Mount Nyiragongo in the Democratic Republic of Congo when he decided to peer over the edge to get a closer look. He reportedly abseiled into the volcano's crater to capture these stunning images of what a raging volcano and lava lake looks like.\nPassage 3: Italian geologist Francesco Pandolfo travelled to Africa to study the volcanic activity on Mount Nyiragongo. He abseiled into the active volcano's crater to examine the lake of molten lava that sits on top of it. In one image the expert looks like a small dot as he sets up his camera next to the mile-wide crater.\nPassage 4: This image shows how close Mount Nyiragongo lies to the nearest town. When it erupted in 2002 it destroyed much of the town of Goma, leaving 200,000 people homeless as lava flowed more than 12 miles from the volcano to the edge of the city's airport\nPassage 5: Nyiragongo's last major eruption was in 1977, when lava flows killed almost 2,000 people in less than half an hour when fast flowing lava drained from a lava lake.

Mt Etna Volcano (Sicily, Italy) 37.73 N, 15.00 E, summit elevation 3350 m, Shield volcano Thursday 17th January, 2002\nPassage 6: Nyiragongo erupted last week, spewing some 250 million cubic metres of lava - the equivalent of about 125,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools - on Goma, the largest city in eastern Congo. No one knows how many people the volcano killed.\nPassage 7: Nyiragongo Volcano (Democratic Republic of Congo) Wednedsay 23rd January, 2002. Dieudonne Wafulah recognized all the signs: the earthquakes, the smoke, the change in the crater's shape. Mount Nyiragongo, the mountain the vulcanologist had studied for 15 years without pay, was about to blow.\nPassage 8: There were reports of another volcanic eruption at Mount Nyimuragira, a neighbouring volcano (14 km northwest of Nyiragongo), that had erupted in February 2001. While no visual confirmation of the eruption has taken place, ash deposits have been noted.\nPassage 9: Into hell: Photos capture smouldering lakes of lava and shifting crust INSIDE the crater of active volcano Mount Nyiragongo.

Make a house call. Before you write a check, visit the doctor's office to see whether you like the practice. Ask how long appointments are and what services are included.

The USB 3.0 Promoter Group announced on 17 November 2008 that the specification of version 3.0 had been completed and had made the transition to the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF), the managing body of USB specifications.\nPassage 1: USB cables are available in multiple lengths, from around 3 feet to just over 16 feet in length. The maximum length of a USB cable is 16 feet 5 inches (5 meters) for high speed devices and 9 feet 10 inches (3 meters) for low speed devices.\nPassage 2: USB 1.x is an external bus standard that supports data transfer rates of 12 Mbps and is capable of supporting up to 127 peripheral devices.\nPassage 3: Short for Universal Serial Bus, an external bus standard that supports data transfer rates of 12 Mbps. A single USB port can be used to connect up to 127 peripheral devices, such as mice, modems, and keyboards. USB also supports Plug-and-Play installation and hot plugging. Starting in 1996, a few computer manufacturers started including USB support in their new machines. It wasn't until the release of the best-selling iMac in 1998 that USB became widespread. It is expected to completely replace serial and parallel ports. Also see USB 2.0.\nPassage 4: USB, short for Universal Serial Bus, is an industry standard developed in the mid-1990s that defines the cables, connectors and communications protocols used in a bus for connection, communication, and power supply between computers and electronic devices.\nPassage 5: USB implements connections to storage devices using a set of standards called the USB mass storage device class (MSC or UMS). This was at first intended for traditional magnetic and optical drives and has been extended to support flash drives.\nPassage 6: USB devices. Today, there are millions of different USB devices that can be connected to your computer. Below are just a few of the most common USB devices you'll likely find and use. 1  Camera. 2  External drive. 3  iPod or other MP3 player.\nPassage 7: Short for Universal Serial Bus, USB (pronounced yoo-es-bee) is a standard that was introduced in 1995 by Intel, Compaq, Microsoft and other computer companies.\nPassage 8: Type-A plugs and receptacles from both USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 are designed to interoperate. Type-B plugs and receptacles in USB 3.0 are somewhat larger than those in USB 2.0; thus, USB 2.0 Type-B plugs can fit into USB 3.0 Type-B receptacles, while the opposite is not possible.\nPassage 9: 1 USB runs with a 5 V power line, while FireWire in current implementations supplies 12 V and theoretically can supply up to 30 V. 2  Standard USB hub ports can provide from the typical 500 mA/2.5 W of current, only 100 mA from non-hub ports.\n\nAnswer: \n",

Rachel slights the opposition very nicely Rachel Carson: \u201cTHE OBLIGATION TO ENDURE\u201d. 4 by keeping it simple yet informative and persuasive and stays away from being caught in a fallacy which makes it readable and proves effective in validlating her point of view.\nPassage 2: The essay starts out with the statement \u201cThe history of life on earth has been an interaction between living things and their surroundings\u201d (Carson, pg. 57). On the other hand, it closes with \u201cThe obligation to endure gives us the right to know\u201d (Carson, pg. 6). These are good statements that give the reader an idea of what can be expected. However, there were times when it seemed as if the author was backing up her opinion with facts that were not necessarily factual.\nPassage 3: Ashley Deemer. Eastern gateway Community College. Abstract. In the following pages the reader will find a written rhetorical analysis of Rachel Carson\u2019s \u201cThe Obligation to Endure.\u201d The following analysis involves the second chapter of Carson\u2019s book, Silent Spring and was antecedently written in 1962.\nPassage 4: The Obligation to Endure by Rachel Carson Rachel Carson's essay on The Obligation to Endure, is a very convincing argument about the harmful uses of chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers on the environment.\nPassage 5: Carson believes that as man tries to eliminate unwanted insects and weeds, however he is actually causing more problems by polluting the environment with, for example, DDT and harming living things. Carson adds that the intensification of agriculture is causing other major problems, like newly developed or created insects and diseases.\nPassage 6: \u201cThe Obligation to Endure\u201d from Silent Springby Rachel Carson. Copyright \u00a9 1962 by Rachel L. Carson.\nPassage 7: In, \u201cSilent Spring\u201d an excerpt from Rachel Carson\u2019s, \u201cThe Obligation to Endure,\u201d Carson suggests that the pesticides and insecticides we have are harmful to more than just the environment. Rachel Carson is an author who is passionate about the environment and concerned about the well being of its inhabitants.\nPassage 8: 1 Limitation of science - As the world changes over time, the understanging of science ... However Aristotle stated that there is not only one future which is determined by a cause. 2  A man travels in the Yukon on an extremely cold morning with a husky ... the reader only ocasionally gets insight into the inner workings of the mans mind.\nPassage 9: Rachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907, on a family farm near Springdale, Pennsylvania, just up the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. She was the daughter of Maria Frazier (McLean) and Robert Warden Carson, an insurance salesman. She spent a lot of time exploring around her family's 65-acre (26 ha) farm.\n\nAnswer: \n",

Line a 9x13 baking dish with foil.  As the oven is heating up, prep your beets for roasting. Use kitchen shears to trim leaves and upper stems of the beets, leaving about 2 inches of the stems intact at the top of each beet.\nPassage 1: Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wrap beets in 2 or 3 packets of foil. Place on a baking sheet; bake until beets are slightly soft to the touch, 45 minutes to 1 hour depending on their size. Cool beets in packets, then rub off skins (use a paring knife for tough spots).\nPassage 2: 1 Place the beets in the a single layer in the bottom of the foil lined baking dish. 2  Cover the baking dish tightly with foil.  Roast the beets in the oven for 45 minutes to 2 hours (very large beets may take even longer). Use a pair of tongs to flip the beets every 30 minutes to make sure they roast evenly on all sides.\nPassage 3: I think that\u2019s why most people just roast them whole in the oven. It\u2019s makes everything so much cleaner, so much easier. At the end of a long work day, the last thing you want to do is get your hands dirty peeling beets. But then there\u2019s the lovely golden beet. The beauty of the golden beets is that you can peel and chop them up before roasting without staining your hands.\nPassage 4: 1 Cover the baking dish tightly with foil.  Roast the beets in the oven for 45 minutes to 2 hours (very large beets may take even longer). Use a pair of tongs to flip the beets every 30 minutes to make sure they roast evenly on all sides.\nPassage 5: Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Place beets in roasting pan. Add 4 rosemary sprigs and enough water to barely cover beets. Cover pan tightly with foil. Roast beets until tender, about 50 minutes.\nPassage 6: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Melt butter with oil in small saucepan. Pour over beets on sheet; toss to coat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake until heated through, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.\nPassage 7: Baby beets simply roasted to bring out their sweetness need just the barest slip of butter and a sprinkling of fresh rosemary. Candy cane beets, if you can find them at a farmers' market, look especially festive, but so does a medley of red and yellow ones. If baby beets are unavailable, cut peeled roasted large beets into 1-inch cubes.\nPassage 8: Fresh beets, which you can simply cover with foil and roast in the oven, are healthy, easy to prepare, and taste absolutely delicious. Who would have thought that peeling them first, and thus caramelizing them in the oven, would glorify this humble root vegetable to new heights? Of course, red beets are a pain to peel.\nPassage 9: Peel and chop into cubes golden beets. Toss with vegetable oil and put in a baking sheet or tray, making sure the beets are in a single layer. Add salt and pepper to taste. Roast at 400 degrees F for about 25 minutes, or until beets are soft and have golden brown edges.\n\nAnswer: \n",

Many baby showers are held in a home with finger foods provided by the host or hostess, typically with 15-40 guests.\nPassage 1: The process used to edit the genes of human embryos is so easy you could do it in a community bio-hacker space. May 1, 2015, 11:11 AM.\nPassage 2: All a scientist has to do to make it work is inject the right set of CRISPR molecules that they want into a cell \u2014 in this case, an embryo \u2014 and the delivery system seeks out the sections you are looking for. As Medvedik explains, once you have the equipment, you don't need much more to work with CRISPR.\nPassage 3: If markets in designer baby technology are allowed, these markets will be expensive. If so, then only the rich will be able to afford designer babies. The rich will use the technology to give their children greater health, intelligence, and other desirable traits, creating even further inequality. Causing further equality would be wrong.\nPassage 4: Similarly, if it turned out that designer baby technology forever remained too expensive for the bottom 5% of stable households (the kind of households where we would want children to be raised), then this doesn\u2019t on its face call for eliminating the market in designer baby technology.\nPassage 5: Designer babies won\u2019t destroy the human race.

Wealthy Chinese are not-so-secretly creating a race of genetically-superior designer babies by using American surrogates \u2013 and surprisingly, it\u2019s a bargain despite price tags of $20,000 to $50,000. The family gets a second, genetically-designed child and can eventually emigrate to the U.S. once the made-to-order baby turns 21.\nPassage 8: Typical costs: 1  A baby shower typically costs $100-$1,000, depending on the number of guests, the menu and location. 2  The location for a baby shower may range from no cost (for a home or church) up to $200 to reserve a community space for the shower guests. For example, the Mifflin Township Community Center in Gahanna, OH, costs $200 for four hours (or $100 for residents of the township) and can accommodate 80 shower guests.\nPassage 9: Designer babies won\u2019t destroy the human race.

Note also that this trend has periodic interruptions, called mass extinctions. The average rate over the past 200 my is 1-2 species per year, and 3-4 families per my. The average duration of a species is 2-10 million years (based on last 200 million years). Mass extinctions. Roughly 20 are recognized, of which 5 are major and the largest is the Permean, in which 50% of all marine families and 80+% of all marine species went extinct.\nPassage 1: Ordovician\u2013Silurian extinction events (End Ordovician or O-S): 450\u2013440 Ma at the Ordovician-Silurian transition. Two events occurred that killed off 27% of all families, 57% of all genera and 60% to 70% of all species. Together they are ranked by many scientists as the second largest of the five major extinctions in Earth's history in terms of percentage of genera that became extinct.\nPassage 2: Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event (End Triassic): 201.3 Ma at the Triassic-Jurassic transition. About 23% of all families, 48% of all genera (20% of marine families and 55% of marine genera) and 70% to 75% of all species became extinct.\nPassage 3: Two events occurred that killed off 27% of all families and 57% of all genera. Together they are ranked by many scientists as the second largest of the five major extinctions in Earth's history in terms of percentage of genera that went extinct. Source(s): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_...\nPassage 4: The K-T Extinction event. 1  Dinosaurs, many land plants, ammonites, much marine life perished. 2  The explanation: a huge meteor, perhaps 150 km in diameter, collided with Earth.  Alternative explanations: dual meteors, or massive volcanic activity triggered by a meteor.\nPassage 5: Estimates of the number of major mass extinctions in the last 540 million years range from as few as five to more than twenty. These differences stem from the threshold chosen for describing an extinction event as major, and the data chosen to measure past diversity.\nPassage 6: At the end of the Frasnian Age in the later part(s) of the Devonian Period, a prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all genera and 70% of all species. This extinction event lasted perhaps as long as 20 Ma, and there is evidence for a series of extinction pulses within this period.\nPassage 7: Best Answer: There have been 5 Mass Extinction events in Earth's history. They are. 1.Cretaceous\u2013Tertiary extinction event (End Cretaceous or K-T extinction): 65.5 Ma at the Cretaceous.Maastrichtian-Paleogene.Dania... transition interval. The K\u2013T event is now called the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene (or K\u2013Pg) extinction event by many researchers.\nPassage 8: The most recent and debatably best-known, the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, which occurred approximately 66 million years ago (Ma), was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time.\nPassage 9: Extinction is a natural event  perhaps 95% of all the species that have ever lived have gone extinct. By late 1700s, as more fossil species were unearthed, catastrophism became the dominant explanation.\n\nAnswer: \n",

The favorite choice for the term Whole Wheat Bread is 1 regular slice of 100% Whole Wheat Bread which has about 13 grams of carbohydrate. The total carbohyrate, sugar, fiber and estimated net carbs (non-fiber carbs) for a variety of types and serving sizes of Whole Wheat Bread is shown below. Popular Serving Sizes of Whole Wheat Bread.\nPassage 1: Quick Answer. There are 79 calories in each piece of white bread. The average person uses two pieces of bread to make a sandwich. That means that a person consumes 158 calories from bread with each sandwich.

Your daily values may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs. Some of these foods were entered by users and are subject to error.\nPassage 3: Thus with less water and with the vast majority of the starch and proteins intact, by weight, toast is more calorific than the original bread but as James Shaw says the difference should be pretty small (about 10%) since bread is only 30% water and when toasted does not dry out totally.\nPassage 4: Calories Burned For Running or jogging: 5 mph (12 minutes per mile) Calories Burned For Running or jogging: 5.5 mph (11 minutes per mile) Calories Burned For Running or jogging: 6 mph (10 minutes per mile) Calories Burned For Running or jogging: 6.7 mph (9 minutes per mile)\nPassage 5: There is on average 12.7grams of carbohydrate in 1 slice of white bread.\nPassage 6: So can someone who strives for stable blood sugar that is as close to normal as possible. It\u2019s definitely true that whole wheat flour is much more nutritious than refined (\u201cwhite\u201d) flour. If you tolerate sugar well, definitely choose the 100% whole grain bread; it has more fiber and all kinds of nutrients. But whole wheat and white bread have essentially the same impact on blood sugar, which is to say you might as well be eating a big spoonful of sugar.\nPassage 7: To answer the question how many calories in a slice of bread, there is something to think about. You will need to think about the type of bread, and also the size of the loaf/piece. This will be different for each type of bread that you choose to eat. Some bread has a lot more calories than others, it depends on the quality of the bread in question.\nPassage 8: Calories in Bread The amount of calories in a slice of bread will vary depending on the type of bread and how big the loaf is. One slice of one brand of white bread has 60 cal\u2026ories, but since two slices are usually considered a serving, a serving would be 120 calories. 47 people found this useful.\nPassage 9: I would say that yes, a piece of toast would have marginally less calories, particularly if it is a bit burnt. By burning the bread, you are converting some of the carbohydrates into carbon dioxide, releasing some of the energy stored in the bread. The black surface left on the bread would be unburnt carbon.\n\nAnswer: \n",

        "input": "Please answer the following question based on the provided passages.\n\nQuestion: why is sodium chlorate useful?\n\nPassages:\nPassage 0: First, the explosive (only at concentrations greater than 10% in atmosphere) chlorine dioxide, ClO2 is produced by reducing sodium chlorate in a strong acid solution with a suitable reducing agent (for example, sodium sulfite, sulfur dioxide, or hydrochloric acid). 2), yielding sodium chlorite.\nPassage 1: It seems to confirm that the toxicity is equal to sodium chlorate. From the analogy with sodium chlorate, even small amounts of about 1 gram can be expected to cause nausea, vomiting and even life-threatening hemolysis in Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficient persons.\nPassage 2: An atom stereocenter, also known as a chiral center, is an atom that is attached to four different types of atoms (or groups of atoms) in the tetrahedral arrangement. It can have either (R)- or (S)- configurations.\nPassage 3: Sodium chlorite is a strong oxidant and can therefore be expected to cause clinical symptoms similar to the well known sodium chlorate: methemoglobinemia, hemolysis, renal failure. A dose of 10-15 grams of sodium chlorate can be lethal.\nPassage 4: Sodium chlorate is an odorless pale yellow to white crystalline solid. It is appreciably soluble in water and heavier, so may be expected to sink and dissolve at a rapid rate. Although it is not itself flammable, the solid product and even 30% solutions in water are powerful oxidizing agents.\nPassage 5: Mixtures with combustible materials are very flammable and may be ignited by friction. It is used for making herbicides, explosives, dyes, matches, inks, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, defoliants, paper, and leather.\nPassage 6: Do NOT dispose of exess sodium chlorate in the trash. When heating sodium chlorate, use only a small amount of solid (0.25-0.40 g) in a Pyrex test tube. Inspect the test tube for chips and cracks before use and handle the test tube using a test tube clamp.\nPassage 7: In organic synthesis, sodium chlorite is frequently used as a reagent in the Pinnick oxidation for the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids. The reaction is usually performed in monosodium phosphate buffered solution in the presence of a chlorine scavenger (usually 2-methyl-2-butene).\nPassage 8: The purpose of this inquiry-based experiment is to design a small-scale procedure to determine the chemical equation for the thermal decomposition of sodium chlorate. Sodium chlorate, NaClO3, is a colorless, odorless, white solid that melts at 248 \u00b0C. When heated above 300 \u00b0C, it begins to lose oxygen. The ultimate products of the thermal decomposition of sodium chlorate are oxygen gas and a white solid. Based on the molecular formula of sodium chlorate, three possible reactions will account for the loss of oxygen gas upon heating (Equations 1-3).\nPassage 9: Sodium chlorate is used as a source of oxygen in emergency oxygen generators. So-called oxygen canisters or oxygen candles are found on airplanes, submarines, even the space station\u2013anywhere where oxygen might be in short supply in case of an emergency.\n\nAnswer: \n",

With their small size and huge personalities, the goats have become a much loved part of our homestead. We got our start in the goat world after Dad came home from a friend\u2019s house one night after trying a glass of milk from their goats.\nPassage 2: 1 It contains less lactose than cow\u2019s milk and is filled with vitamins, enzymes and protein. 2  Goat\u2019s milk is less allergenic. (It does not contain the complex proteins that stimulate allergic reactions to cow\u2019s milk) 3  It does not suppress the immune system.  It is easier to digest than cow\u2019s milk.\nPassage 3: 1 It contains less lactose than cow\u2019s milk and is filled with vitamins, enzymes and protein.  Goat\u2019s milk is less allergenic. (It does not contain the complex proteins that stimulate allergic reactions to cow\u2019s milk)\nPassage 4: It actually contains an alkaline ash, and it does not produce acid in the intestinal system. Goat\u2019s milk helps to increase the pH of the blood stream because it is the dairy product highest in the amino acid L-glutamine. L-glutamine is an alkalinizing amino acid, often recommended by nutritionists.\nPassage 5: For many people the best, easiest and cheapest way to feed goats is to provide good leafy grass or legume hay free-choice, plus 2-3 pounds a day of a commercial goat feed (grain ration). Others prefer feeding their goats on pasture as much as possible.\nPassage 6: And of course, they produce rich, delicious milk. A good milking doe will produce an average of about 2-3 quarts a day, but that\u2019s extremely misleading. The main reason is that most goats will produce a lot of milk \u2014 often a gallon or more per day \u2014 soon after kidding. After that peak, production declines, sometimes slowly, sometimes not so slowly.\nPassage 7: Goats are hardy animals, but they do need a dry, draft-free place to sleep and to escape from the hot sun or rain, and an outdoor space to exercise \u2014 especially if you want to produce the best goats for milk. In hot areas where protection from sun and rain is important, a simple roof or lean-to might suffice.\nPassage 8: 1 Goat\u2019s milk does not produce mucus; it does not stimulate a defense response from the human immune system.  Goat\u2019s milk is a rich source of the trace mineral selenium, a necessary nutrient for its immune modulation and antioxidant properties.\nPassage 9: It is good to note that goat\u2019s milk is lacking in folic acid, so if you\u2019re using it to make formula for a young child, or if you choose to consume raw goat\u2019s milk while pregnant, be aware that you should be supplementing with some other form of folic acid.\n\nAnswer: \n",

Men need between 30 and 38 grams of fiber each day, and women require 21 to 25 grams, the MayoClinic.com website notes. Fiber encourages healthy digestion and can help prevent constipation.\nPassage 1: A 1-cup serving of chopped celery contains just 16 calories and no fat and is rich in certain vitamins and minerals. Celery might also prevent certain chronic health conditions. Look for light green celery that is crisp and firm because it has the most nutritional value.\nPassage 2: Try adding some to a salad, tuna/salmon/egg salad, a big pot of soup, stir-fry, smoothie or juice, or just have some as a healthy, low-calorie snack. Many people like to eat celery raw with some nut butter and raisins as \u201cants on a log.\u201d.\nPassage 3: Healthy Green Juice. Great healthy drink for detoxing after the holidays or whenever you have overdone it. Worth it to buy the organic celery, even if you buy conventional for everything else. Adjust fruit and veggie amounts to suit your personal taste. More apple equals a sweeter drink. Store any extra in a glass jar in the fridge for up to a day.\nPassage 4: 3 Delicious and Healthy Celery Juice Recipes. Mixing celery with other healthy fruits and vegetables can produce even more powerful juice with lots of health benefits. Celery can be part of juice recipes for weight loss, blood pressure regulating juices, detox juicing recipes and more. Green Celery Juice Recipe for Weight Loss.\nPassage 5: Vitamins and Minerals. Drink a serving of celery juice, and you will take in 16 percent of the vitamin C you need each day. The vitamin C in celery juice plays a critical role in bolstering your immune function as well as improving your body\u2019s ability to heal wounds.\nPassage 6: I had a request from a reader on the benefits of celery juice and, since it is one of my favorite vegetables to juice, thought I would bring it to the top of the list and post this early. Celery juice has been prized as a cure-all as far back as the Ancient Greeks, Egyptians and Romans.\nPassage 7: Put the chicken, carrots, celery, zucchini and onion in a large soup pot and cover with cold water. Heat and simmer, uncovered, until chicken is throughly cooked. Pour out the water and strain the chicken. Chop the carrots, celery and onion and add to pot with broth and chicken. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nPassage 8: Celery leaves are high in Vitamin A and the root is high in Vitamins B1,B2,B6 and Vitamin C. It is an excellent source calcium, potassium, folic acid, essential amino acids, and phosphorous. Drinking fresh celery juice is an easy way to promote overall wellness and practice preventative health measures.\nPassage 9: This number of calories is on par with the same volume of carrot juice. The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Pyramid calls for you to consume three to five servings of vegetables each day, and drinking a serving of celery juice helps you meet that nutritional goal. Note, however, that one serving of vegetables equals a 3/4-cup portion of celery juice or other vegetable juices.\n\nAnswer: \n",

However, it is less well established whether high levels or triglycerides or uric acid, per se, represent independent cardiovascular risk factors.Rather, both hypertriglyceridemia and hyperuricemia serve as biomarkers for increased coronary heart disease risk.hus, although there is no direct relationship between hypertriglyceridemia and high uric acid levels, they are linked by a common denominator: a diet enriched in fructose.\nPassage 1: High uric acid levels raise the likelihood of a person having elevated triglyceride levels, visceral obesity (increased waist circumference), insulin resistance, hypertension, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, all of which represent features of the metabolic syndrome.hus, although there is no direct relationship between hypertriglyceridemia and high uric acid levels, they are linked by a common denominator: a diet enriched in fructose.\nPassage 2: Gout is a painful condition that occurs when the bodily waste product uric acid is deposited as needle-like crystals in the joints and/or soft tissues. In the joints, these uric acid crystals cause inflammatory arthritis, which in turn leads to intermittent swelling, redness, heat, pain, and stiffness in the joints.n fact, most people with hyperuricemia do not develop the disease. To confirm a diagnosis of gout, a doctor may insert a needle into an inflamed joint and draw a sample of synovial fluid, the substance that lubricates a joint. The joint fluid is placed on a slide and examined under a microscope for uric acid crystals.\nPassage 3: Gout most commonly affects the joints of the big toe, but can occur elsewhere in the body, including the joints and surrounding areas of the foot, ankle, or knee. Gout is caused by an accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints.Crystals can form when abnormally high levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia) are present in the body over an extended period of time.Mild hyperuricemia usually does no harm, and most people with hyperuricemia never develop gout.out most commonly affects the joints of the big toe, but can occur elsewhere in the body, including the joints and surrounding areas of the foot, ankle, or knee. Gout is caused by an accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints.\nPassage 4: Gout is a type of arthritis that occurs when too much uric acid builds up in the body, causing crystals to form in joints, and joints to become inflamed and painful.he acid accumulates in tissues in the form of needle-like crystals that cause pain. Uric acid is formed when the body digests purines, compounds found in some foods and beverages, including dried beans, liver, wine, and beer.\nPassage 5: Over time, increased uric acid levels in the blood may lead to deposits of urate crystals in and around the joints. These crystals can attract white blood cells, leading to severe, painful gout attacks and chronic arthritis. Uric acid also can deposit in the urinary tract, causing kidney stones. Patients may need medications to lower their elevated blood uric acid levels that predispose to gout. 2  The goal is a uric acid level less than 6 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). 3  There are two types of medicine for gout. 4  For control of acute attacks of joint pain, there are NSAIDs, colchicine and corticosteroids.\nPassage 6: For centuries, gout has been associated with obesity and overindulgence in alcohol. As I have discussed before, obesity is linked to development of insulin resistance which also causes elevated triglycerides, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, chronic kidney disease and heart attacks and elevated uric acid levels.or centuries, gout has been associated with obesity and overindulgence in alcohol.

These triglycerides may also be changed into cholesterol. The food that you consume in your diet is either used or stored.

There are many different degrees and titles in the world of diagnosing and treating learning problems and attention deficits. In this post, we\u2019re going to provide you with some practical answers. I\u2019m trying a little something different here.\nPassage 1: We asked our district for an IEE because we disagreed with the school psychologist. The district argued with us for two months, but they finally \u201callowed\u201d us to get an IEE. We got a second ASD diagnosis, ADHD and a new diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. We had been fighting with the district for a year.\nPassage 2: Washington and Oregon state law dictates that the only professionals who can medically diagnose ASD include: board eligible neurologists, board eligible psychiatrists, licensed psychologists, board certified developmental and behavioral pediatricians.\nPassage 3: He said there is no school documentation of any criteria that would indicate an educational diagnosis of Autism. My 11 yr. old daughter has a diagnosis of ADHD, ASPERGER\u2019S DISORDER, RAD. by a Board Certified in both General Psychiatry and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\nPassage 4: You can also find a professional who specializes in ADHD diagnosis through your health plan, your child\u2019s teacher or school counselor, other parents of children with ADHD, or nonprofit organizations such as Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD). ADHD Types and Symptoms.\nPassage 5: We also need to document that concerns and behaviors have continued over a period of time.\u201d. Additionally, students that have a medical diagnosis are not automatically eligible for special education services, according to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).\nPassage 6: Jackie \u2013 a school psychologist can diagnose a child with an emotional disturbance. A school psychologist is one of the eligibility team members but more often than not they are the only team member to fully understand eligibility criteria for special education.\nPassage 7: With that being said, some will say that a medical doctor should diagnose ADHD, because it is a medical condition. The medical doctor can rule out other medical conditions. However, I can give you a list of doctors that I personally know will give an ADHD diagnosis after a 15 minute interview with the parent.\nPassage 8: Although some pediatricians with special training in the disorder will diagnose ADHD in children, most will refer you and your child to a mental health professional such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, counselor, or social worker trained in diagnosing and treating the disorder.\nPassage 9: ADHD: A Primer for Parents and. Educators. BY ANNE M. HOWARD, PHD, Chicago School of Professional Psychology, IL. STEVEN LANDAU, PHD, Illinois State University, Normal.

If your testosterone level is low they can put you on something like androgel, a topical that has testoster\u2026one in it. It gets absorbed through your skin and into your blood stream. If your doctor won't cooperate, go online to an anti-aging site.\nPassage 3: Controlled Substance Schedules. List of Controlled Substances. This document is a general reference and not a comprehensive list. This list describes the basic or parent chemical and does not describe the salts, isomers and salts of isomers, esters, ethers and derivatives which may also be controlled substances.\nPassage 4: It should be pointed out that a substance does not need to be controlled for a sport to ban it if it so chooses. In fact, many drugs banned in sports are not controlled substances. For instance, beta-blockers which slow the heart rate (used for blood pressure and heart disease) are banned in archery.\nPassage 5: With the passage of the Anabolic Steroid Act of 1990 Congress bypassed the usual regulatory process (which a few years earlier under the Reagan Administration concluded that anabolic steroids should not be classified as controlled substances) that determines which drugs should be controlled, and concluded that testosterone and other anabolic steroids be classified as controlled substances.\nPassage 6: Definition of Controlled Substance Schedules Drugs and other substances that are considered controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) are divided into five schedules. An updated and complete list of the schedules is published annually in Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) \u00a7\u00a7 1308.11 through 1308.15.\nPassage 7: Testosterone is a hormone made by your body in the testes, the reproductive glands that make sperm. The amount of testosterone your body produces is controlled by the brain's hypothalamus and the pituitary gland.\nPassage 8: Section 812 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7801 et seq.) (CSA) lists substances which were controlled in 1970 when the CSA was enacted. Since then many substances have been added, removed, or transferred from one schedule to another.\nPassage 9: To effect these changes, testosterone is often converted into another androgen called dihydrotestosterone. In women, testosterone is produced by the ovaries and adrenal glands. The majority of testosterone produced in the ovary is converted to the principle female sex hormone, oestradiol. How is testosterone controlled? The regulation of testosterone production is tightly controlled to maintain normal levels in blood, although levels are usually highest in the morning and fall after that. The hypothalamus and the pituitary gland are important in controlling the amount of testosterone produced by the testes.\n\nAnswer: \n",

I got a plastic bottle with a cone shaped tip like those used for Boric Acid. Once filled with Diatomaceous Earth, I set out to dust under the refridgerator, stove, and along the baseboards in the kitchen.\nPassage 6: Best Answer: Yes it will and so will non grade diatomaceous earth. The way it kills is... Diatomaceous Earth is a very very fine abrasive with particles similar to pieces of broken glass.Very sharp. When roaches walk,crawl, across it, the earth collects under the scales of their bodies which in turns stops oxygen from getting to them and they die.iatomaceous earth is sharp on a microscopic scale and will keep slugs/snails out of garden plants if sprinkled on top of the ground. It might work with roaches but roaches have harder bodies and the diatomaceous earth might not harm them.\nPassage 7: In my earlier posts about my roach killing expedition, I mentioned my discovery of Diatomaceous Earth.

Cat's claw (U\u00f1a de Gato in Spanish) is a thorny vine that can grow up to 100 feet in the tropical regions of South and Central America. Its name comes from the rounded thorns that look like cat's claws that grow on the vine.\nPassage 2: Cat\u2019s claw can be taken as a capsule, tea, extract or in tincture form. A tincture is a mixture of liquid extract and alcohol for a highly potent formula. Making the Tea. The tea can be made by boiling water and adding a few drops of lemon juice. Lemon juice will help cat\u2019s claw tea to naturally release the beneficial tannins of the herb.\nPassage 3: Add the cat\u2019s claw to the cup. If your cat\u2019s claw is ground, use 1 to 2 tsp. in a typical tea strainer. If you are using cat\u2019s claw bark, add one to two average-sized pieces. Let the cat\u2019s claw steep for five to 10 minutes.\nPassage 4: Today, cat\u2019s claw is used as a dietary supplement for a variety of health conditions including viral infections (such as herpes and HIV), Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cancer, arthritis, diverticulitis, peptic ulcers, colitis, gastritis, hemorrhoids, parasites, and leaky bowel syndrome.\nPassage 5: Cat\u2019s claw extracts inhibited the growth of and increased programmed cell death in leukemia cells . 8) Cat\u2019s Claw Boosts the Immune System Cat\u2019s claw enhances the immune system by increasing the levels of key immune cells (T helper and B cells) and the activity of granulocytes [R, R, R, R].\nPassage 6: Unless you have health issues that conflict with the usage of cat\u2019s claw, it can be an amazing natural remedy with minor side effects, if any. One of its most popular uses in the United States is for the treatment of various forms of arthritis, and science backs up this usage.\nPassage 7: Cat\u2019s claw helps protect joint cartilage and has displayed efficacy in relieving joint pain, indicating it may be helpful for people suffering from arthritis. Cat\u2019s claw extract improves markers of immune system health in animals and humans, suggesting that it may help defend against infectious invaders. Cat\u2019s claw protects cellular DNA against damage and supports the repair of damaged DNA.\nPassage 8: However, TOA free Cat's Claw is pricier. And there is a strong argument that basic whole Cat's Claw's natural balance has been healing for ages. The argument goes further by stating there is no proof of TOA free Cat's Claw's superiority.

Cat\u2019s claw appears to have few side effects but presently very little scientific research has been done on the benefits and possible side effects of this herb. There have been reports of dizziness, nausea, and diarrhea when taking cat\u2019s claw and as it has been used traditionally for birth control it should not be used when pregnant as it may cause miscarriage.\n\nAnswer: \n",

        "input": "Please answer the following question based on the provided passages.\n\nQuestion: difference between miniature american shepherd and miniature australian shepherd?\n\nPassages:\nPassage 0: The Miniature American Shepherd was developed in California during the late 1960's with the breeding of small, unregistered dogs that were thought to be Australian Shepherds. These dogs were bred with a goal of maintaining their small size, active character and intelligence.\nPassage 1: #1. Hi everyone...I'm just wondering...what's the difference between an Australian Shepherd and a Border Collie? I have an Australian Shepherd right now and I know that Border Collies are cousins with them. I had a Border Collie before but I was very young, and I can't remember the behavior of him.\nPassage 2: National Parent Club - American Kennel Club. The Miniature American Shepherd Club of the USA (MASCUSA) was selected in May of 2011 as the parent club of the Miniature American Shepherd for the American Kennel Club.\nPassage 3: MASCUSA was originally known as the Miniature Australian Shepherd Club of the USA, and then the North American Miniature Australian Shepherd Club of the USA, and was founded in 1990 as original parent club for the Miniature Australian Shepherd.\nPassage 4: Best Answer: The Miniature American Shepherd is a breed that could possibly be registered by the AKC some day. Breeders are working hard to get this breed recognized. Although they bear a resemblance to the Australian shepherd they are NOT mini aussies and no breeder of them will claim they are. They are their own breed.\nPassage 5: What is the Difference Between Mini American Shepherd &. Miniature Australian Shepherd??? When Miniature Australian Shepherds achieved AKC recognition, it came with a new name too - Miniature American Shepherd. With AKC recognition, we can now participate in AKC venues with our Miniature American Shepherds.\nPassage 6: Australian shepherds are vigilant and affectionate dogs that excel in herding animals. Although the standard for the breed is mid-sized, smaller varieties are commonly bred, as well. These varieties are referred to as miniature and toy Australian shepherds. Miniature and toy specimens are not the exact same size.\nPassage 7: A Miniature American Shepherd is a Mini Australian Shepherd that has been registered with AKC or UKC. The only difference is where the dog is registered. The Australian Shepherd and the Miniature American Shepherd are genetically inseperatable. The Miniature American Shepherd is a small Australian Shepherd. The Australian Shepherd stands 18-23 inches tall at the shoulder and the Miniature American Shepherd stands 13-18 inches tall at the shoulder. They have the same look, working style, intelligence, energy level, personality, grooming requirements, etc.\nPassage 8: The Miniature American Shepherd is the dog that is bred by a breed club that is recognized by the AKC. They are mistakenly called Mini Aussies by the uneducated and of course those trying to pass dogs off that are not Miniature American Shepherds.\nPassage 9: Toy Australian shepherds are even smaller than the miniatures. Mature toy Australian shepherds usually reach heights of between 10 and 14 inches. The breed size categorization doesn't just end there, either. Australian shepherds smaller than the toys are sometimes referred to as teacups..\n\nAnswer: \n",

They see a car moving in the distance, and they simply have to give chase. Some dogs are so motivated to chase cars that they\u2019ll even lie in wait at the side of the road or in a ditch and, as a car approaches, they\u2019ll leap out to head it off.f you have a dog who already has a problem chasing cars, consult with a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB), a board-certified veterinary behaviorist or a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT). (Please see our article, Finding Professional Help, to help you locate a professional in your area.).\nPassage 1: Prevention. To prevent your dog from ever starting to chase cars, you need to catch the first moment he shows interest in the motion of the car and redirect his attention to you-something else fun!f you have a dog who already has a problem chasing cars, consult with a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB), a board-certified veterinary behaviorist or a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT). (Please see our article, Finding Professional Help, to help you locate a professional in your area.).\nPassage 2: While you undergo changing your dog\u2019s car chasing behavior, you should consider an invisible fence to help reinforce the idea that while outside, your dog needs to stay in your yard. If you have a tree in the front yard or something else sturdy, you can also tie your dog up with enough slack to enjoy exploring the yard.Make sure you use a strong enough rope or material to keep your dog in place, even when temptations arise.raining. While the above steps can be taken immediately, it is important to also teach your dog to stop chasing when you do not want him to. The best way to do this is to hone in on the command \u201ccome.. Once your dog masters this skill he should always fall back and come to you based on your voice command.\nPassage 3: Stopping a Dog from Chasing Cars. I'm not so concerned about Old Blue chasing cars, starts the old joke, it's when he brings 'em home and buries 'em in the yard that I start to get worried.Dusty jokes aside, car chasing is a problem for some dogs.'m not so concerned about Old Blue chasing cars, starts the old joke, it's when he brings 'em home and buries 'em in the yard that I start to get worried.Dusty jokes aside, car chasing is a problem for some dogs.\nPassage 4: Although chasing is a natural inclination in many dogs, if you can interrupt your dog\u2019s behavior and teach him that doing something else-such as turning toward you-is more enjoyable than chasing cars, you can nip chasing in the bud before it becomes a habitual problem.f you have a dog who already has a problem chasing cars, consult with a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB), a board-certified veterinary behaviorist or a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT). (Please see our article, Finding Professional Help, to help you locate a professional in your area.).\nPassage 5: Attention and Exercise. Sometimes dogs are more inclined to chase cars because they have pent-up energy and they have a natural desire to chase. By giving your dog extra attention and plenty of exercise, you can help curb this extra need to chase something.Even better, incorporate chase in play time!raining.

Once your dog masters this skill he should always fall back and come to you based on your voice command.\nPassage 6: If you can get your dog obedience trained well enough you can train him to stop on command, but if you are not paying attention when the car drives by you may be too late in stopping your dog. Doing special car chasing training is wise if your dog is a car chaser.utting in an underground electric or above-ground fence is your best bet. But if this is not possible or you would like to have your dog out with you outside the fence, you can try using a shock collar with a hand-held control. When the dog chases after a car you shock him. Do not say he word no when you shock him.\nPassage 7: Prevention continued... Not all dogs who chase cars from inside a fenced yard will also chase cars when they\u2019re loose. But some will as the thrill of the chase becomes too strong to ignore. In addition, some dogs get so excited running the fence that they can hurt themselves or jump the fence.Chasing cars from inside a fence can also develop into chasing other things, like joggers or skateboarders, when they pass the yard.f there is virtually no chance that your dog can get out of the yard and your dog doesn\u2019t show any interest in chasing other moving things, car chasing from inside a fenced area is relatively \u201csafe\u201d and good exercise for an understimulated (bored or underexercised) dog.\nPassage 8: If you have a dog who already has a problem chasing cars, consult with a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB), a board-certified veterinary behaviorist or a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT).

Teach your dog to only chase what he can bring back to you. Just about all dogs like to chase; it is in their nature. From chasing game to trial criminal chasing, to a dog a car is no different than a huge rabbit.utting in an underground electric or above-ground fence is your best bet.

        "input": "Please answer the following question based on the provided passages.\n\nQuestion: would human urine keep deer away?\n\nPassages:\nPassage 0: One, sprinkle dog hair or human hair liberally around and through your garden. Be generous with the hair close to plants deer prefer like beans. Usually, deer leave onions and peppers alone. Sources for hair are all around.\nPassage 1: \u201cBut it\u2019s unlikely deer associate human urine with humans, unless a human leaves their scent behind along with the urine.\u201d. Miller agrees. \u201cDeer aren\u2019t genetically programmed to be able to identify human urine.\nPassage 2: A quick caution is not to do this if small children may be around the garden. Moth balls may look interesting to them and possibly could go into a kid\u2019s mouth. Again, rain will reduce the time this treatment works to keep away deer. Be generous with the amount of moth balls or crystals you put out, too. Some Arkansas gardeners say that urine is a deer deterrent \u2014 human urine, dog urine or coyote urine. The latter is available commercially, if you can find it. Close neighbors may not appreciate this in your garden, but modest amounts of urine probably don\u2019t hit on human nostrils nearly as much as on a deer\u2019s.\nPassage 3: Deer that don't get knocked off by cars (the predators that have taken over from wolves and coyotes) show a particular fondness for some of the most beloved and costly garden plants and flowers\u2014apple trees, rhododendrons and azaleas, tulips and roses.\nPassage 4: Marking territory ... to keep out the deer. Gardeners can learn to weather drought and hail, burning heat and killing frost, even transient insect attacks. But it's harder to adapt to 150-pound hoofed creatures tearing at your plants. In the battle of man vs. deer, passions run high.\nPassage 5: Experts also offer some other recommendations. Utah Cooperative Extension recommends reapplying the urine granules regularly, and rotating between a variety of repellents to keep out deer or whatever other animal is ravaging the garden.\nPassage 6: To use coyote urine to fool deer into thinking a predator is lurking, gardeners are supposed to hang a bottle with holes in it filled with urine-soaked cotton balls in trees or posts around the vulnerable plants. Alternatively, they can spray the urine directly on the plants.\nPassage 7: Again, the only surefire protection against most animals is a physical barrier. For deer, this means an 8-foot fence. For rabbits, voles and other animals, it might also include an underground barrier. Also keep in mind that coyote urine might attract coyotes looking for a mate.\nPassage 8: It's a simple theory: Spread predator animals' scents to scare away prey animals. In reality, predator urine is only sometimes effective in keeping deer, rabbits and other pests out of the yard. If used properly, it may be an effective part of a garden pest control strategy, but it is not guaranteed to work.\nPassage 9: Coyote urine has roughly equal power in repelling deer to concentrated Hot Sauce-brand repellent and Deer Away, an organic spray that contains about 5 percent fermented egg solids. Concentrated Hot Sauce-brand repellent was the only product that outperformed urine on elk.\n\nAnswer: \n",

Trout eat a host of aquatic insects, terrestrial insects, other fish, crustaceans, leeches, worms, and other foods. The food items that are most important to trout and fly fishers are the aquatic insects that spend most of their life cycles underwater in rivers, streams, and stillwaters.\nPassage 2: Smaller fish (including other trout) and eels. Crustaceans such as crayfish and shrimp. Tadpoles and frogs. Worms and snails. Large trout will eat small mammals, such as mice, that fall in the water and even baby birds such as ducklings. Trout will eat the eggs of other trout. 49 people found this useful.\nPassage 3: The steelhead (sometimes called steelhead trout) is an anadromous (sea-run) form of the coastal rainbow trout (O. m. irideus) or Columbia River redband trout (O. m. gairdneri) that usually returns to fresh water to spawn after living two to three years in the ocean.\nPassage 4: Fishing Tips: Rainbow Trout eat insects, crayfish, fish, and fish eggs. They are susceptible to a wide variety of tackle. Fly-fishing with streamers, wet and dry flies can be effective. Spinning and bait casting tackle includes small spinners, spoons, worms, and hellgramites.\nPassage 5: A potamodromous population in Lake Superior is known as coaster trout or, simply, as coasters. The brook trout is the state fish of nine states: Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia, and the Provincial Fish of Nova Scotia in Canada.\nPassage 6: The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a trout and species of salmonid native to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean in Asia and North America.\nPassage 7: State Record: 4 lbs, 12 oz. Fishing Tips: Brook Trout are aggressive feeders eating insects, crayfish, salamanders, and other fish. Food is typically in short supply in headwater streams so Brook Trout rely heavily prey that falls into the stream (e.g., ants, caterpillars, inchworms).\nPassage 8: Brook trout. The brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) is a species of freshwater fish in the salmon family Salmonidae. It is native to Eastern North America in the United States and Canada, but has been introduced elsewhere in North America and to other continents.\nPassage 9: Beginner bug blueprints\u2014mayflies, caddis, stoneflies, midges, terrestrials, and more of what trout eat. Mayfly duns have opaque wings and ride the water in an upright position. Trout eat a host of aquatic insects, terrestrial insects, other fish, crustaceans, leeches, worms, and other foods. The food items that are most important to trout and fly fishers are the aquatic insects that spend most of their life cycles underwater in rivers, streams, and stillwaters.\n\nAnswer: \n",

As Carter wrote in Vanity Fair this past November, \u201cTo this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump.\nPassage 1: Donald Trump speaks during his first press conference since winning the election in the Trump Tower in New York, on January 11. His body language demonstrates the power of nonverbal forms of communication. Shannon Stapleton/Reuters.\nPassage 2: Trump, she says, is a great study of how a person\u2019s gesturing, posture and facial expressions can be both confusing and persuasive. \u201cHe is the perfect person to say the nonverbal has the power,\u201d she says of Trump. \u201cPeople don\u2019t hear the words, they don\u2019t really pay attention to the verbal message.\nPassage 3: Donald Trump speaks during his first press conference since winning the election in the Trump Tower in New York, on January 11. His body language demonstrates the power of nonverbal forms of communication. Experts have long known that humans communicate with much more than just words.\nPassage 4: As Steven Taylor noted yesterday afternoon, Donald Trump released what he purported to be his birth certificate, his latest publicity stunt in the bizarre circus he\u2019s been engaged in lately. There\u2019s just one problem. The document Trump released isn\u2019t an official birth certificate:\nPassage 5: Just what is Donald Trump hiding in his tax returns? Trump blustered on Tuesday that he essentially would not reveal his tax returns to the public until after the November election, or until the IRS audit is completed, (meaning after the election), making him the first candidate since 1976 to refuse to reveal his tax returns. Gerald Ford released a tax summary that year, but not his full records.\nPassage 6: Donald Trump\u2019s Tax Returns May Be Hiding This Bombshell from the 1990s. It's plausible to believe that, deep inside Donald Trump's many years of tax returns, which he has declined to make public, a surprise lurks. Heck, we already know him to be a serial exaggerator, at minimum, a person who has testified that his feelings influence his calculation of his net worth.\nPassage 7: What Is Wikipedia Hiding About Donald Trump's Tiny Shrimp Fingers? When the faceless editors of Wikipedia decide an article is not fit for public consumption, it\u2019s gone, only accessible to the site\u2019s top editors\u2014at least, it was. But now we\u2019re keeping track of all the articles Wikipedia doesn\u2019t see fit to print, to present you with very best of the site\u2019s weirdest and worst.\nPassage 8: But the question is one of the most intriguing in the saga of Trump's revival. (The following analysis does not imply that Trump did anything unethical. Employing the insolvency exclusion, if indeed he used it, is a legitimate way to lower liability. It's a strategy that responsible tax advisers recommend all the time.\nPassage 9: When pressed, Trump adds that no one but a few media losers are interested in his taxes. More recently, though, Donald Trump Jr. has said the real reason is simpler: not only are people interested in Trump's taxes, but they're too interested. Releasing his tax returns would detract from his father's message. Whatevs.\n\nAnswer: \n",

The site was also an important fortress protecting Attica and held several other important festivals, notably the Thesmophoria, the subject and title of a comedy play by Aristophanes.\nPassage 1: Here are some examples. In Alexandria Ptolemy IV Philopator (reigned 221-205 BCE) was a devotee of Dionysus. In Rome Emperor Augustus (reigned 44 BCE to 14 CE) was an initiate of the Eleusinian Mysteries and a devotee of Apollo. Under his rule, in 28 BCE, a splendid temple of Apollo was built on the Palatine Hill.\nPassage 2: There were two Eleusinian Mysteries: the Greater and the Lesser. The Lesser Mysteries were held in Anthesterion (March) (the exact time was not always fixed and changed occasionally, unlike the Greater Mysteries). The priests purified the candidates for initiation myesis.\nPassage 3: The Eleusinian Mysteries were the most famous of the secret religious rites of ancient Greece. They consisted of the Lesser Mysteries and the Greater Mysteries.

But this cult was more than merely a state religion of the usual Greek model.\nPassage 6: The Psychedelic Cult That Thrived For Nearly 2000 Years. The Eleusinian Mysteries are a set of traditions that have been practiced for 2000 years. The popular pseudo-religion invited all, accepting slaves, women, and men, regardless of financial standing and background. Advertisement.\nPassage 7: THE GREATER MYSTERIES AT ELEUSIS.

Also most real estate offices will have a notary that will do it for free hoping to get your business one day. I think the maximum notary fee here in AZ is $2.00 per notarized page if they want to charge you. Notary fees by state: Maximum Notary Fees By State: Don\u2019t Get Ripped Off By Big Fat Notary Guys! | Punny Money.\nPassage 1: Everyone Looped-In. If you wish, you can invite your collegues or manager to a job (great for when you are on vacation), or invite realtors and lenders, allowing them to view the details of a job, and even get email and text notifications when the status changes!\nPassage 2: Public offices where you can find a notary public include the local clerk of court\u2019s office and sometimes a public library. Law offices commonly have a notary on staff. If you need a power of attorney form notarized, you can generally have it done for free at the office of the attorney who prepared the document for you. Notarized documents are sometimes shipped overnight, so some UPS or FedEx stores have a notary public available.\nPassage 3: Step 2: Scan over the document. To look for certificate wording that will tell you what type of notarization to perform. To review the certificate wording to make sure it contains all the elements a Notary certificate should have and that it conforms to the requirements of your state. To check for blank spaces.\nPassage 4: There are few states that give new Notaries practical tips when performing their first notarization. Even states that have mandatory education requirements for commission applicants focus more on Notary law than Notary practice. To help the new Notaries in our community, here are 5 steps to a proper notarization:\nPassage 5: Banks Can Notarize Your Documents for Free. If you need to get a document notarized, a simple, free solution can usually be found at the nearest branch of your bank. Getting a document notarized is typically very simple. Present the document to a notary public and sign it in her presence.\nPassage 6: An apostille is a form of authentication issued to documents for use in countries that participate in the Hague Convention of 1961. If the country of intended use does not participate in the Hague Convention , documents being sent to that country can obtain a Certificate of Authentication.\nPassage 7: Notaries charge a modest fee for this service. Fees charged often depend on where you get a document notarized. Many states set maximum allowable charges, and notaries can charge any amount up to that maximum (and they can also charge nothing at all). In many cases, notarial charges are between $2 and $20 per signature.\nPassage 8: To obtain an apostille you must send the following information: Original notarized document to be authenticated or a certified copy to be authenticated that includes the original certification. Fee is $15.00 per document (a document can be more than one page).\nPassage 9: Original notarized document to be authenticated or a certified copy to be authenticated that includes the original certification. 1  Fee is $15.00 per document (a document can be more than one page). 2  Make check or money order payable in U.S. dollars (USD) to: Secretary of State.\n\nAnswer: \n",
